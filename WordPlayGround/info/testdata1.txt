30 Whether you’ve chosen to take the easy route or the barrier-strewn path, you are sure to find 
challenges galore as you inaugurate your administration. Your god-like terraforming powers 
may have dwindled, but the position of Mayor comes with plenty of muscle. Mayor mode affords 
you ample scope to exercise your megalomania, be it for good or evil. 
Build roads! Add cloverleafs to your highway system! Plop the Taj Mahal in your city center! 
Zone! Beautify! Spend! Destroy! This is where the action is. The real challenge of SimCity 4 
Deluxe is to be a Mayor who keeps loyal citizens happy, healthy and prosperous. If you put 
your Sims first, budget wisely, and keep your ears and eyes open to all kinds of information 
about your city, you will be on your way to achieving hero status in your city. If you sought out 
the position of Mayor mostly to line your own pockets—how long can you keep the city on the 
brink of disaster while you milk it dry? 
As you build your city’s infrastructure, you have a wealth of information available to keep tabs 
on your city—from your current Mayor rating to trend data on education levels. Never forget to 
seek out the Sim’s-eye view of what’s going on. You might stop a crime wave in its tracks if you 
listen to the man, woman, or child on the streets. 
This section takes you through the basic tools available to you as Mayor. Good luck! 
  LANDSCAPE TOOLS 
Now that you’ve established your city, you can still grow mountains—at a cost. Gods can sculpt 
terra firma for free, but this sort of landscaping comes with a price tag for Mayors, which may 
limit your ambitions. The mortal world also greatly reduces the scale and effect of these tools, 
compared to their powers in God mode. But hey! All of the special universal functions available 
to you in the God Mode Terraforming Tools are available here (e.g., v and q 
keys, the q-1 through 0, etc.). You may plan to make your upscale neighborhood 
even more upscale with a nice ridge formation, but beware! If you landscape too close to 
development, you destroy buildings and other structures. The following tools allow you to modify 
your city’s terrain:

Is it time—to be Mayor? 
Do you have the empire-building skills to develop a metropolis of soaring skyscrapers or the 
aesthetic sensibilities to create a city that delights the eye? Do you enjoy tinkering with an 
entire world—widening a river bed there, increasing a tax rate here—to see the effects on 
the inhabitants under your sway? Or do you want to get down and dirty with The Sims in your 
streets, taking on missions that have you hurtling down highways in a tank? Whether you tend 
to the god-like or mortal, SimCityTM4 Rush Hour offers infinite opportunities for you to create (or 
destroy) the metropolis of your dreams! 
SimCity 4 Rush Hour gives you power that extends from the god-like creation of mountainscapes 
to the adjustment of funding levels at a local elementary school. You’d like a certain Sim to 
commute to work on a pogo stick? Thy will be done. You may create a mountain aerie of 
high-tech industry, or a bustling urban manufacturing center. With SimCity 4 Rush Hour, you 
can even interconnect the two cities to trade jobs, goods, and services. Whether you use your 
creativity to develop independent cities, or prefer to offer your Sims a larger view on life 
through interdependent communities, you must make your world a prosperous and desirable 
place for your citizens to live. It can be quite a challenge, but don’t worry. If you get too 
frustrated with events, you can always unleash meteor showers upon your land. 
How will you know if you are succeeding as Mayor? You have a myriad of information at your 
fingertips. Your city statisticians work tirelessly to provide you with data, graphs, and reports 
that keep your finger on your city’s pulse. You know in which corner of your city crime is at its 
worst, where the best-educated Sims live, and which roads are most congested. But that’s not all. 
With SimCity 4 Rush Hour, your Sims can contact you directly with their thoughts and feelings 
about your administration. If you are a really outgoing Mayor, you can interview passing Sims 
on the streets to get their views. Not content with just passersby? Want even more impact on 
your Sims’ lives? Import your favorite Sims from The SimsTM to live in your city! If you haven’t 
created your own Sims, we’ve provided some individuals for you to direct and follow as they go 
about their lives. Choose what they drive, which routes they use to get to work, and where they 
live. Your Sims complain if you raise taxes. If they live near a source of unchecked pollution, they 
get sick. If they can’t get a job, they move out of the city altogether! In the ideal city, your Sims 
work hard, die peacefully at a ripe old age, and pass the torch to the next generation. 
Ah, so you want even more direct contact with the lifeblood of your city? You are hard to 
please, Mayor, but the answer is here. You now have the ability to build increasingly complex 
and varied transportation networks—providing your city with arteries of commerce and 
productivity. Allow congestion to get out of hand, and watch the car wrecks pile up! And, Mayor, 
you may be causing some of those crashes. With SimCity 4 Rush Hour’s all new U-Drive-It 
feature, you can accept missions for the betterment of your citizens, or cause mayhem in your 
city as you drive the streets, ply the waters, or fly through the clouds in vehicles you pilot. Will 
you get Jenny to the hospital in time for her heart transplant, or are you aiding the evil Dr.
