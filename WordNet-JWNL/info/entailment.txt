JWNL Reverse Entailment Package
Requires JWNL Version 1.1 or greater

The reverse entailment, or entailed by, relationship is simply the opposite of the entailment relationship. For example, if "to limp" 
entails "to walk" then "to walk" is entailed by "to limp". Having this relationship available is necessary for certain forms of term 
expansion when doing natural language processing. You don't have to know what this means, only know that if you are using my JNLI 
package, you must install this package.

Usage

java -cp jwnl.jar;utilities.jar net.didion.jwnl.utilities.AddReverseEntailment <properties file> <new verb index filename> <new verb data filename>

Properties file is the path of the properties file to use. New verb index/data filenames are the names of the files to create for the
index/data that contain reverse entailment pointers.

After running this program, back up your existing copies of the verb index and data files in the word net dictionary directory. 
Then rename the newly created index/data files appropriately and place them in the word net dictionary directory.

Please Note: Installing these files over the top of your existing verb data/index files will cause the wordnet browser that comes
with the wordnet distribution to stop working because it does not recognize reverse entailment relationships. If you want to be able
to use this browser, I recommend creating a seperate directory for the new verb data and verb index files and putting a copy of all
the other dictionary files into that directory.
