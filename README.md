# word-playground
Word interaction for young children

A prototype application exploring a 'playground for words' where letters can be joined together and broken apart. When broken apart the words break phonetically so the individual elements of the word are visible. The words are pronounced using a prototype custom speech engine.  

Words are formed/broken apart based on the Java WordNet Library. (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwordnet/)
